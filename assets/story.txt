... I went to that party, back in the days. 

... The job description was amazing. It was the perfect job for me. So I thought. They did not give me the job. I should have prepared myself for the interview. I hate myself.

...I felt lonely, back in the days. Just like now. But there was someone else. We both were  lonely. Why didn't I talk to her? Why didn't I smile at her? I hate myself.

Your friend from first grade died when he was 12. It was in a car accident which was caused by a mechanical failure. He always wanted to write a postcard, to you.
